            <p class="text">Notwithstanding any other provisions of these Terms of Use, or any general legal principles to the contrary, any provision of these Terms of Use that imposes or contemplates continuing obligations on a party will survive the expiration or termination of these Terms of Use.</p>
            <p class="text bold">Force Majeure</p>
            <p class="text">The Company shall be excused from performance under these Terms of Use or the Terms of Purchase, to the extent it is prevented from or delayed from performing, in whole or in part, as a result of an event or series of events caused by or resulting from (1) weather conditions or other elements of nature or acts of God, (2) acts of war, acts of terrorism, insurrection, riots, civil disorders or rebellion, (3) quarantines or embargoes, (4) labor strikes, or (5) other causes beyond the reasonable control of the Company.</p>

            <p class="text">If any of the provisions set forth in these Terms of Use or the Terms of Purchase are deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, the parties agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the unenforceable condition shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions of these Terms of Use or the Terms of Purchase. Section headings are for reference purposes only and do not limit the scope or extent of such section. These Terms of Use or the Terms of Purchase and the relationship between you and the Company will be governed by the laws of the United States, to the extent not preempted by or inconsistent with federal law, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. For any actions not subject to arbitration, we each agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a court located in the United States.</p>
            <p class="text">The failure of the Company to act with respect to a breach of these Terms of Use or the Terms of Purchase by you or others does not waive the Company’s right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. If any content on this Site, or your use of the Site, is contrary to the laws of the place where you are when you access it, the Site is not intended for you, and we ask you not to use the Site.

You may not amend or modify these Terms of Use under any circumstances. It is your responsibility to check periodically for any changes we make to the Terms of Use. Your continued use of this Site after any changes to the Terms of Use means you accept the changes.</p>

            <p class="text">You may not assign these Terms of Use or the Terms of Purchase (or any rights, benefits or obligations hereunder) by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the Company, which may be withheld at the Company’s sole discretion.
